    """
    The method make_even_spacing_read_pattern() is a helper function to generate a read pattern
    for MA Tables with evenly spaced resultants. This is needed because the current MA Tables in
    the RTB Database do not have the same specifications to replace files on CRDS that are used
    for build and regression testing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_resultants: integer; default=None
        Integer number of resultants in exposure.
    num_rds_per_res: integer; default=None
        Integer number of reads per resultant for evenly spaced averaged resultants.

    Returns
    -------
    read_pattern: list of lists
        Nested list of lists that are taken created from existing meta data or accessed by new meta roman data models.
