The innerspace page above has basic structure for any reference file type in the RFP repo. It is meant to be a model 
for how to start generating code for a new reference file type and class that will create the reference file utilizing
the data model needed. 

Also see https://github.com/spacetelescope/roman-wfi-reference-pipeline/blob/main/src/docs/how_to_make_new_reftype.txt
which is basically a step by step procedure needed to generate a new reference type and meta handlers used for development
and testing.
