"""
Annalisa please use this file to migrate code from Tyler's notebook to here. 

The goals for this file would be:
 - Understand all of the dependencies and versions of packages needed to run the original code
 - Identify package versions that have been updated since the original code was created and how it impacts code changes in the updated version you'll be working on
 - Have this script be working and functional to produce everything needed to make a new version of the photom reference file
 - This will be our baseline for an implementation that we will then refactor and put into photom.py
